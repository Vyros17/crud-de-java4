Create a Sequence: Run the following SQL command in your PostgreSQL database:


CREATE SEQUENCE car_sequence START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
Modify the Entity (Optional): If you want to explicitly associate the sequence with your entity, update your CarEntity like this:

SELECT sequence_name 
FROM information_schema.sequences 
WHERE sequence_schema = 'public';

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "car_seq")
@SequenceGenerator(name = "car_seq", sequenceName = "car_sequence", allocationSize = 1)
private long id;
